# Output:
# Merged and sorted arrays:
# Array A: [1, 2, 3, 4]
# Array B: [5, 6, 7, 8]
# Time Complexity: O(n log n), where n is the total number of elements in both arrays.
# Space Complexity: O(1), since we are merging in place without using additional space
# This code merges two sorted arrays in place, ensuring that the final result is sorted.
# It uses a two-pointer technique to compare elements from both arrays and swaps them as necessary.
# The arrays are then sorted to ensure the final merged result is in order.
# The function handles cases where the arrays have different lengths and ensures that all elements are included in the final result.
# The merged arrays can be used for further processing or output, and the function can be adapted for various applications where merging sorted data is required.
# The function ensures that the merged arrays are sorted and that the elements from both arrays are preserved in the final result.
# The approach is efficient and works well for merging sorted arrays, making it suitable for various applications in data processing and analysis.
